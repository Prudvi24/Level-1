Inheritance
---------------------------
To inherit the properties / characteristics from the parent / ancestors.

Lets say we have two classes

1st class : Car
	  1. Color
	  2. maxspeed
	  3. gears

2nd class : Bicycle
	  1. color
	  2. maxspeed
	  3. peddleType
	  
The first two properties are common in above two classes.
	This is redundancy.
	Now, we create common class having common properties and inherit when required.
	
Main advantage of inheritance : Reusing the code.

==========================================================

We have 3 access modifier
	1.private
	2.protected and
	3.public

private  : Not accessible outside the class
public   : Accessible by third party.

But sometime, it is required to give someone provision to access the property and some can not access the property.

This can be achieved by "protected".

protected : Accessible only to the child class.
